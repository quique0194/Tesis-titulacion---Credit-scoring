Current credit scoring research does not exploit the feature of the datasets of being of an imbalanced nature. For this reason, in this work, a recent bagging method for imbalanced data was imported to the credit scoring domain. Four base classifiers of different families and three heterogeneous datasets were used as evidence. After running the experiments, the results are quite encouraging; the area under de curve (AUC) improved for ten out of twelve base classifiers. In addition, the created bagging classifiers were statistically superior than the modern bagging classifiers Random Forest and XGBoost. Finally, we compare the results with the results of other studies of the state of the art in two benchmark datasets, confirming that the results are quite competitive.
